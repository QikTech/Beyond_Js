# Execution Context & Call Stack in JavaScript

#### Quick Summary
‚úÖ Execution Context manages variable & function execution. <br>
‚úÖ Call Stack follows LIFO (Last In, First Out). <br>
‚úÖ Every function call creates a new Execution Context. <br>
‚úÖ Stack Overflow occurs with infinite recursion. <br>
‚úÖ Async tasks are handled outside the stack.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Execution Context (EC)

### An Execution Context is the environment where JavaScript code is executed. It consists of:

+ Variable Environment (Memory allocation for variables, functions)
+ Lexical Environment (Scope chain)
+ This Binding (Value of this in that context)

### There are three types of Execution Contexts:

+ Global Execution Context (GEC) ‚Äì Created when JavaScript starts execution.
+ Function Execution Context (FEC) ‚Äì Created every time a function is called.
+ Eval Execution Context ‚Äì Created when eval() is used.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Execution Context Creation Phases

### When a function is invoked, the Execution Context goes through two phases:

#### üîπ Creation Phase (Memory Allocation)

+ Allocates memory for variables and functions.
+ Functions are stored entirely, while variables get undefined (Hoisting).

#### üîπ Execution Phase

+ Executes line by line.
+ Assigns values to variables and executes functions.
