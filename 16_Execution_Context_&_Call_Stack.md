# Execution Context & Call Stack in JavaScript

#### Quick Summary
‚úÖ Execution Context manages variable & function execution. <br>
‚úÖ Call Stack follows LIFO (Last In, First Out). <br>
‚úÖ Every function call creates a new Execution Context. <br>
‚úÖ Stack Overflow occurs with infinite recursion. <br>
‚úÖ Async tasks are handled outside the stack.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Execution Context (EC)

### An Execution Context is the environment where JavaScript code is executed. It consists of:

+ Variable Environment (Memory allocation for variables, functions)
+ Lexical Environment (Scope chain)
+ This Binding (Value of this in that context)

### There are three types of Execution Contexts:

+ Global Execution Context (GEC) ‚Äì Created when JavaScript starts execution.
+ Function Execution Context (FEC) ‚Äì Created every time a function is called.
+ Eval Execution Context ‚Äì Created when eval() is used.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Execution Context Creation Phases

### When a function is invoked, the Execution Context goes through two phases:

#### üîπ Creation Phase (Memory Allocation)

+ Allocates memory for variables and functions.
+ Functions are stored entirely, while variables get undefined (Hoisting).

#### üîπ Execution Phase

+ Executes line by line.
+ Assigns values to variables and executes functions.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Call Stack

### The Call Stack manages function execution in a Last In, First Out (LIFO) order.
    // Example
    
    function first() {
      console.log("First Function");
    }
    
    function second() {
      first();
      console.log("Second Function");
    }
    
    second();
    console.log("Global Execution");

#### Execution Process:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Global Execution Context is created. <br>
2Ô∏è‚É£ second() is called ‚Üí New Function Execution Context (FEC) is created. <br>
3Ô∏è‚É£ Inside second(), first() is called ‚Üí Another FEC is created. <br>
4Ô∏è‚É£ first() executes and pops off the stack. <br>
5Ô∏è‚É£ second() executes and pops off the stack. <br>
6Ô∏è‚É£ console.log("Global Execution") executes.

#### Call Stack Flow

    1. Global Execution Context ‚Üí Push
    2. second() ‚Üí Push
    3. first() ‚Üí Push
    4. first() ‚Üí Pop
    5. second() ‚Üí Pop
    6. Global Execution ‚Üí Pop (Execution Ends)

    // Output:
    
    First Function
    Second Function
    Global Execution

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Call Stack Overflow

### If a function calls itself indefinitely, it causes a stack overflow error.

    function recurse() {
      recurse(); // Infinite Recursion
    }
    recurse(); // ‚ùå Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Relation to Asynchronous Code

+ JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning only one function executes at a time.
+ Async tasks (e.g., setTimeout(), Promises, API calls) are handled outside the stack using Event Loop and Callback Queue.
